# Aseprite

Aseprite is a free and open-source spriting software that is very popular amongst
indie game developers thanks to its ease of use and extensibility

## Integration with balamod

The balamod contributors made an extension for aseprite in order to more easily
make sprites for Balatro, respecting the existing color palettes, and format for
jokers, consumables, vouchers and so on.
